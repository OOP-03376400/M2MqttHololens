# M2MqttHololens
a version of M2MqttDotnetCore that can be a git submodule


# Including as a SubModule
The simplest way to add the tools to your project is via a submodule. This will create and internal link within your repo to the MRDesignLab set of tools.
To do this simple navigate to your Assets folder in your project and use:
```
git submodule add https://github.com/cicorias/M2MqttHololens.git ./M2MqttHololens
```

This will create the submodule for M2MqttHololens and allow you to stay up to date with changes to the base toolset or decide not to integrate newer changes.
